# Workflow Resource Variable
> **Description**  
Manage and monitor variables/resources as an outcome of each subflow.
---

**Workflow Resource Variable** refers to the ability to manage and monitor **resource variables** generated by each subflow during the workflow lifecycle. These resources are the data outputs or intermediate results required for downstream logic execution.

## Key Functions:

- **Auto-generated** when a new subflow is defined and configured.
- Available resources include: variable outputs, API responses, calculated fields, status flags, etc.
- Resources can be **mapped, reused,** or **passed** to other subflows or components.
- Easily viewable and editable via the W**orkflow Resource Panel**, improving debugging and customization.
- Essential for workflows that involve **conditional logic, data transformation,** or **multi-step calculations.**

> **Example Use Case :**  
In an ECL computation workflow, a subflow calculating probability of default (PD) may generate a resource variable called PD_12_Month, which is then passed to another subflow that multiplies it with Exposure at Default (EAD) to compute expected credit loss.  
Each subflow generates resources—variables or outputs—automatically. These are monitored, reused, and passed through other workflow stages.
> - Resources include outputs, flags, and intermediate values
> - View/edit via Workflow Resource Panel
> - Essential for multi-stage processes like PD-LGD-EAD modeling
