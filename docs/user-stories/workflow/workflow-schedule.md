# Workflow Scheduling
> **Description**  
Details on how to create workflow scheduling

---

**Workflow Scheduling** in the REGLA application enables users to automate workflow execution at predefined times or intervals. This is essential for workflows that need to run periodically—such as batch calculations, regular data ingestion, or nightly report generations—without requiring manual initiation.

## Key Capabilities:

- Users can define **one-time schedules** or set **recurring schedules** (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Supports **cron-style scheduling** for flexible timing setups.
- Integrated with **calendar-based triggers** to prevent overlaps or clashes.
- Ensures **automatic execution** of workflows based on the assigned schedule, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
- System sends **notifications** or alerts in case of failure or schedule conflicts.

> **Example Use Case :**  
Automating IFRS 9 ECL calculations every quarter by setting a recurring schedule ensures timely regulatory reporting.
