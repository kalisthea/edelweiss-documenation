# Workflow Template
> **Description**  
**"Create once. Reuse everywhere."**

---

## What is a Workflow Template?

- The **Workflow Template** feature in the REGLA Workflow Module allows users to **standardize and reuse predefined workflow structures** across multiple projects or departments — saving time, ensuring consistency, and reducing manual configuration errors.

- Templates act as **blueprints** containing workflow logic, element structures, and process flows that can be imported, customized, and executed as needed.

- This is especially valuable in regulated environments like financial services, where repetitive processes such as **ECL calculation, risk data validation,** or **regulatory reporting** need to follow uniform steps while still being flexible enough for business-specific customization.

## Key Functions of Workflow Template

- **Standardization:** Use a consistent structure for workflows across different teams and use cases.
- **Efficiency:** Eliminate the need to rebuild workflows from scratch.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Allow teams to share best-practice workflow designs within the organization.
- **Customization:** Templates can be adjusted post-selection to suit business needs, without changing the original template.

## Using Workflow Templates in REGLA

- When accessing the **Template Manager** in the Workflow Module:
    - If the **workflow canvas is empty**, the system will **automatically close** the template manager and **reload** the workflow with the selected template.
    - If there’s an existing workflow in the canvas, selecting a new template will prompt a **confirmation dialog** asking: 

        > "Do you want to replace the current workflow with the selected template?"

    - This safeguard ensures users don’t unintentionally overwrite existing workflows.

## Summary Notes

- Templates are best used as starting points for frequently repeated workflows (e.g., periodic impairment calculations or regulatory data extractions).
- A template **cannot be applied on top of an existing workflow** without user confirmation.
- Reloading with a template clears the current workflow canvas and imports the selected structure.

Templates help organizations scale automation faster, maintain compliance, and drive operational consistency — a powerful asset in REGLA’s flexible and audit-friendly environment.
